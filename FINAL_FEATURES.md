<svg viewBox="0 0 300 120">
  <linearGradient id="snakeGradient">
    <stop offset="0%" stopColor="#10b981" />      {/* Green */}
    <stop offset="50%" stopColor="#06b6d4" />     {/* Cyan */}
    <stop offset="100%" stopColor="#8b5cf6" />    {/* Purple */}
  </linearGradient>
  
  {/* Snake body - wavy path */}
  <path d="M 20 40 Q 40 20 60 30..." stroke="url(#snakeGradient)" />
  
  {/* Snake head */}
  <circle cx="270" cy="25" r="6" fill="#8b5cf6" />
  
  {/* Snake tongue */}
  <path d="M 275 25 L 285 20 M 275 25 L 285 30" />
  
  {/* Text */}
  <text x="150" y="90">HardWord Hex</text>
</svg>
```

### Sound Generation
```typescript
// Web Audio API - dynamic tone generation
const playSound = (type: 'click' | 'delete' | 'submit' | 'win' | 'lose') => {
  const ctx = getAudioContext();
  const osc = ctx.createOscillator();
  const gain = ctx.createGain();
  
  // Set frequency, type, and duration based on sound type
  osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(startFreq, now);
  osc.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(endFreq, now + duration);
  osc.type = 'sine' | 'square';
  osc.start(now);
  osc.stop(now + duration);
};
```

### Mobile Responsive Classes
```tsx
// Game board cells: Scale across devices
cellSize = 'w-9 h-9 sm:w-11 sm:h-11 md:w-13 md:h-13 lg:w-16 lg:h-16'

// Keyboard buttons: Progressive sizing
className="min-h-10 sm:min-h-12 md:min-h-13 lg:min-h-14"

// Overall gaps: Mobile-first reduction
gap-1 sm:gap-1.5 md:gap-2 lg:gap-3
```
